    "description": "Summon Jué to leap into the air, dealing {0} Spectro DMG to the enemies and bringing forth Lightthunder. Lightthunder hits up to 5 times in total, each dealing {1} Spectro DMG to the surrounding enemies. Then Jué spirals downward to attack the surrounding enemies, dealing {2} Spectro DMG two times in a row. \nThe Resonator equipped with this Echo Skill obtains 1 stack of \"Blessing of Time\" every 6s, stacking up to 3 times. When the Resonator performs Resonance Skill, 1 stack of \"Blessing of Time\" is consumed, dealing {3} Spectro DMG to the surrounding enemies. The enemies hit receive {4} Spectro DMG per second over 6s, stacking up to 3 times and new stacks extending the effect period. The damage dealt through consuming the stacks of \"Blessing of Time\" is considered as Resonance Skill DMG.\n\nCD: {5}s"
