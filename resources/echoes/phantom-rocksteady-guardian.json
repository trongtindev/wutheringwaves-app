Upon being attacked, deal Spectro DMG equal to {0} of the current character's Max HP, and perform a follow-up attack that deals Spectro DMG equal to {0} of the current character's Max HP.\n \nUse the Echo skill again to exit the transformation.\n \nIf the attack received is a <color=Highlight>Special Skill</color> attack, interrupt the enemy's <color=Highlight>Special Skill</color>, gain a Shield equal to 30% Max HP, and perform a two-stage follow-up attack, each inflicting Spectro DMG equal to {1} of the current character's max HP. These follow-up attacks simultaneously launch three ground-breaking waves, each inflicting Spectro DMG equal to {2} of the current character's Max HP.\n \nCD: {3}s</color>"
