  "bgDescription": "A small frog often found on the banks of the rivers and lakes. Their habitat is often established on lush bushes. When it rains, they often come out to feed on snails and earthworms. Therefore, after rain, Black-Striped Frogs can often be seen crossing the roads in an attempt to return to the waterside.",
