  "bgDescription": "An unlocked Sundial-shaped puzzle box. The direction and time symbols on its disks have been rearranged. However, you have already obtained the key information given by the Jinzhou Magistrate. Now, it appears to be an ordinary small sundial. Only upon closer inspection can you see a faint light source at the top and the shadow of the needle is distorted, almost like a hushed whisper."
