  "bgDescription": "Also known as \"Winter Cloud Soup”. A luxury congee made by slow-cooking Caltrop with poultry broth. The key to make this dish is the control of the heat and the ratio of the ingredients. The slow cooking with a gentle heat preserves the original sweetness of the Caltrop. Paired with Honeysuckle, even a lonely night will feel happy."
