  "bgDescription": "Changli's favorite dish, which is made with extra chilis.\nThe vibrant redness hints at its intense flavor, which seems to leap out of the bowl. Served alongside rice and a cup of osmanthus syrup, amidst the bustling ambiance of Huangdou Mingting, it provides a heavenly culinary experience.\nWhile few in Mingting, apart from Changli, venture to taste this delicacy, it's a cherished household favorite among families in Hongzhen. Accompanied by wine, it adds an extra layer of warmth to the dining experience."
